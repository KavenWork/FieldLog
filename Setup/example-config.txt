# FieldLog configuration file
#
# This file controls how the application installed in this directory writes log files.
#
# You can edit this file with a plain text editor like Windows Notepad. Please avoid rich text
# editors like Microsoft Word or WordPad though.
#
# Each line contains a setting and its value, separated by "=". Empty lines and unknown settings
# are ignored. Contents are case-insensitive. The path setting defines a path and log file prefix
# of where to write the log to. There will be multiple files created with the same file name
# prefix. The max...size settings are defined in bytes, with valid suffixes k, M and G. The
# keep... settings define log keep times for each priority, with valid suffixes s (seconds), m
# (minutes), h (hours) and d (days). Changes to this file are applied automatically at runtime
# with a few seconds delay.
#
# See http://unclassified.software/source/fieldlog/devguide#config for more information.
